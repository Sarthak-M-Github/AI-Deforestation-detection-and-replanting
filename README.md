# AI Deforestation Detection and Replanting

##  Overview
This project was designed as a research-oriented study to **compare machine learning models** for two tasks:

1. **Deforestation Detection**  
   - Applied multiple ML/DL algorithms on **satellite forest cover images** and related environmental data.  
   - Evaluated performance of models such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and MLP.

2. **Smart Replanting**  
   - Built a curated dataset with features like soil type, rainfall, and region.  
   - Tested different models to recommend the **most suitable tree/crop species** for replanting on present dataset.  

The aim was **benchmarking and comparison of model performance**, providing insights for future practical applications.

## Large Files (EarthEngine Folder)
The `EarthEngine/` folder contained large datasets and model files of deforestation model that exceeded GitHubâ€™s file size limits.  
You can access them here: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/your-folder-link-here)

*(Download the files and place them inside an `EarthEngine/` folder in the project root if you want to run the code locally.)*
